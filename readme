MYDU

Name
	mydu - An implementation of the command du (estimate file space usage) in C

Synopsis
	mydu [OPTION]... [FILE]

Description
	-a show counts for all files

	-s Display only a total for each argument

	-h Append the correct M, G, B for size (Megabyte, Gigabyte, Byte, ensure power of 1024)

	-H same as -h except use powers of 1000 instead of 1024

	-k translate block size to kb 

	-L dereference symbolic linls

	-x FILE will exclude based on patterns supplied from the FILE, one per line
	if FILE == '-' then take from stdin

Bugs:
	Crash on invalid argument
	-h and -H create crash. They are currently disabled.
	-x has not been implemented
	File size does not always match du as expected
	This is not a correctly optimised program and experiences memory leak. 
		Only a noticeable on very large directory trees. 
	
Notes:
	This 'mydu' does support the output of multiple parameter files
		ex: 'mydu /classes /boot' will output the files of /classes followed by /boot
